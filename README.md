# Problem


As described in the Insight challenge, the purpuse of program mechanism is to find **Top 10 Occupations** and **Top 10 States** for **certified** visa applications


# Program

This program consists of four functions which deal with file reading, data counting, data sorting, and data writing, respectively.  The users can input the name of the file to be analyzed which will be read by the program. The visa information can be used to filter the data, for example CERTIFIED, DENIED, etc.  The users can specify their own items utlized to count the number of H1B visa applications. Finally, the users can point out the output file and directory.


# How to run program

The user needs to put any csv file to be analyzed into the input folder, and corresponding filename is required to input into the program. The visa information will be specified by the user and input into the program. The items to be counted can be specified by users (for instance, JOB_TITLE, WORKSITE_STATE), then the program will automatically do the statistical work based on the items provided by the users.  The users can also specify the names of output files which be generated into output folder.
